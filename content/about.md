summary: Hi! I'm a full-stack web developer based in Chicago, Illinois. I
  learned JavaScript back in 2017 and eventually expanded my toolkit to include
  its related frameworks such as Express and React. Programming is an
  ever-changing field and I challenge myself to learn the newest technologies;
  outside of web development I'm also interested in eventaully tackling the
  fields of Augmented Reality and Machine Learning. Below you can see a list of
  technologies I'm familiar with as well as projects I have accomplished.
