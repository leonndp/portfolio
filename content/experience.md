    role: Front-End Developer
    description: I helped develop and maintain Canvas, a scalable Next.js-based frontend platform upon which web apps for Hyatt's brands and properties are built. Canvas ensured the API integration and general front-end infrastructure was consistent across different brands, allowing us to push common updates from a central point, while also still allowing us to implement a wide variety of different themes across them.
